- updated to 0.4.3
- removed Require: giFT. giFTcurs does NOT require it.
- removed automake from BuildRequires and from %build (caused errors).
- changed Summary: and %description to apropriate one (giFT has nothing to do with FastTrack).
- TODO: something is wrong with language. When build from rpm, giFTcurs doesn't display messages in Polish.
